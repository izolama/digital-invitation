# Multi-stage build for optimized production image

# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (including devDependencies for build)
RUN npm ci && npm cache clean --force

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Install curl for health checks (wget sometimes missing in alpine)
RUN apk add --no-cache curl

# Copy custom nginx config
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Health check using curl instead of wget
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/health || exit 1
